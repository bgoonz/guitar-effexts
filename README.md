# GuitarStack

Electric guitar effect stack in the browser, using the Web Audio API

[![Video demo](https://raw.github.com/lucaong/guitarstack/master/video_preview.png)](https://vimeo.com/243462500?autoplay=true)

## Usage

For best results, you need a guitar-to-USB interface. I use a [Behringer
UCG102](https://www.thomann.de/gb/behringer_ucg102.htm)

Then, plug your guitar, [open GuitarStack](https://lucaong.github.io/guitarstack/) and rock on!

## Effects

  * Compression
  * Overdrive
  * Distorsion
  * Delay
  * Amp with Reverb
  * Tremolo
  * Chorus / Flanger

## Caveats

At the moment, GuitarStack only works in Chrome
